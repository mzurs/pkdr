# PKDR Finance

The project mainly concentrates on how conventional finance and financial applications work -by equipping a variety of use cases to the users, including P2P Transfers, On-Time Deposits, Withdrawals, Identity Verification, Data management, Account Activity, and Fraud Alerts. PKDR Finance, on the other hand, knowing all the vulnerabilities of conventional finance, has -come up with a different approach to address all those problems and create a financial application on top of a decentralized ledger. The Pak Digital Ruppee (PKDR) platform is a Web 3.0 application that uses a public ledger to authenticate users. To interact with the application users need to register with the platform, and the system validates all the provided information. PKDR uses a different stack to address this and manages different keys. PKDR Finance enables the users to send and receive digital money, as all users are authenticated with the system -transactions happening on-chain. MultiSig approval to transfer money -this comes in handy when there are malicious transactions. Until and unless users are using PKDR Finance -no such money laundering activities will be done as all users are verified and transactions are recorded and trackable.
